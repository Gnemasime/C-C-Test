# C-C-Test
C/C++ assessment from invisible technologies
# C/C++ Test 1:
Given an array of string `words` and a maximum width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line contains words packed together without exceeding `maxWidth` charachters. Each line should start with the first word in the list and continue to add as many words as possible until the maximum width is reached or exceeded. If a single word is longer than the maximum width, it will be placed on a new line by itself



Example:



Input:

words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]

maxWidth = 10;



Output:

this is an

example of

text

justification



# C/C++ Test 2:
Create a C/C++ program that performs the transposition of a matrix. The program should read a matrix from the user, transpose it and then print the transposed matrix.



Example Input:

Rows: 2

Columns: 3

Matrix:

1 2 3

4 5 6



Example Output:

Original matrix:

1 2 3

4 5 6



Transposed matrix:

1 4

2 5

3 6
